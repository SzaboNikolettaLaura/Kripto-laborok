This is a sample text file for testing the Hill cipher encryption and decryption.
The Hill cipher is a polygraphic substitution cipher based on linear algebra.
Each letter is represented by a number modulo 26 (often A = 0, B = 1, ..., Z = 25).
To encrypt a message, each block of n letters is multiplied by an invertible n Ã— n matrix, modulo 26.
To decrypt the message, each block is multiplied by the inverse of the matrix used for encryption.
